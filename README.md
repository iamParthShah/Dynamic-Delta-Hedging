# Dynamic-Delta-Hedging
C++ code to test and perform dynamic delta hedging and generate tracking error

We use the GOOG stock and option chain data to track the delta hedging errors and change the rebalance time to observe the change in error magnitude.
Main.cpp contains the code flow. We have created the classes for repsective functionalities which are self explainatory.
